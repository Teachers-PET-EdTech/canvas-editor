# Simple Editor for Canvas HTML
Use this project to quickly and simply edit the colors and basic elements of a Canvas--or other educational LMS--page with the HTML. The project is made for teachers, instructors, and professors who are starting out with the HTML-editor inside of Canvas. 

This tool is best when paired with the Canvas Templates from Teacher's PET (teacherspet.tech).

## Usage

The project runs on the web, so you don't need to do anything special to get started. Once the page is running, copy and paste the HTML code from your current Canvas page or the Teacher's PET template to start editing. 

Place the HTML in the middle column. The preview on the far right will update with the code. 

Change the colors used in the Teacher's PET template by locating every #CODE and replacing the AlphaNumeric series with a new color. You will see the preview update. 

**Note: The Simple Editor provides a glossary of basic color codes to use. You can also find your institution's specific color codes in the Brand Kit from your marketing department. This is typically a public document that you can find on their website.**

When you finish editing the HTML and are satisfied with the preview, copy/paste the code directly into the HTML editor in your Canvas page or assignment.

## Contribution Guidelines and License

Teacher's PET makes tools for educators, by educators. Our mission rests on empowering professionals across the learning space with simple to use and helpful tech. Update and add features to this simple editor that will make a teacher's course prep time easier and faster. 

We built this Simple HTML Editor off of the Monaco Editor, under the MIT License. The focus on educator needs with the updated div display and color glossary were the primary additions for this project.

### Planned Roadmap: We want to add

* A way to highlight all the color codes in the HTML so users can find those aspects more quickly
* A glossary of common HTML elements so users can add simple boxes and buttons to their pages
* An import option to pull in Template content with out the Copy/Paste
* Additional color codes that are common to University branding to the glossary
